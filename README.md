Brain-Computer Interface (BCI) Project

This repository contains the code and final report for a Brain-Computer Interface (BCI) project where EEG data was acquired, preprocessed, features extracted, and signals classified for playing the game Brainrunners.The project involved the collection of EEG data from subjects using a 2-electrode system during task performance. The collected EEG data underwent preprocessing, which included artifact reduction techniques. Subsequently, features were extracted from the preprocessed EEG data to facilitate classification. A classifier was developed to categorize EEG signals and map them to different actions, enabling control of the avatar in the BCI game. The project repository comprises sections for preprocessing, feature extraction, and classification, each containing relevant code scripts. Additionally, a comprehensive final report in PDF format documents the project's methodologies and the achieved performance results in the BCI game.
