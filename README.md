Brain-Computer Interface (BCI) Project
This repository contains the code and final report for a Brain-Computer Interface (BCI) project where EEG data was acquired, preprocessed, features extracted, and signals classified for controlling an avatar in a BCI-based game.

Flow of Work
Data Acquisition: EEG data was collected from subjects using a 2-electrode system while performing various tasks.
Preprocessing: The EEG data underwent preprocessing steps including artifact reduction techniques.
Feature Extraction: Features were extracted from the preprocessed EEG data to prepare it for classification.
Classification: A classifier was developed to classify EEG signals and assign them to different actions for controlling the avatar in the BCI game.
Repository Contents
Preprocessing Code: Contains scripts for preprocessing EEG data, including artifact reduction techniques.
Feature Extraction Code: Includes code for extracting features from preprocessed EEG data.
Classification Code: Contains the code for developing and implementing the classifier for EEG signals.
Final Report: PDF file containing detailed methods used in the project, along with the final performance results achieved in the BCI game.
